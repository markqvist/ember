### AI-Generated Media

When a slide scene needs an image or video but no suitable PDF image exists, mark it for AI generation:

- **If no suitable PDF images exist** for a slide scene that would benefit from visuals, add `mediaGenerations` array with image generation prompts. Write prompts in English. Use `elementId` format like "gen_img_1", "gen_img_2" — IDs must be **globally unique across all scenes** (do NOT restart numbering per scene). To reuse a generated image in a different scene, reference the same elementId without re-declaring it in mediaGenerations. Each generated image should be visually distinct — avoid near-identical media across slides.
- Add a `mediaGenerations` array to the scene outline
- Each entry specifies: `type` ("image" or "video"), `prompt` (description for the generation model), `elementId` (unique placeholder), and optionally `aspectRatio` (default "16:9") and `style`
- **Image IDs**: use `"gen_img_1"`, `"gen_img_2"`, etc. — IDs are **globally unique across the entire course**, NOT reset per scene
- **Video IDs**: use `"gen_vid_1"`, `"gen_vid_2"`, etc. — same global numbering rule
- The prompt should describe the desired media clearly and specifically
- **Language in images**: If the image contains text, labels, or annotations, the prompt MUST explicitly specify that all text in the image should be in the course language (e.g., "all labels in Chinese" for zh-CN courses, "all labels in English" for en-US courses). For purely visual images without text, language does not matter.
- Only request media generation when it genuinely enhances the content — not every slide needs an image or video
- Video generation is slow (1-2 minutes each), so only request videos when motion genuinely enhances understanding
- If a suitable PDF image exists, prefer using `suggestedImageIds` instead
- **Avoid duplicate media across slides**: Each generated image/video must be visually distinct. Do NOT request near-identical media for different slides (e.g., two "diagram of cell structure" images). If multiple slides cover the same topic, vary the visual angle, scope, or style
- **Cross-scene reuse**: To reuse a generated image/video in a different scene, reference the same `elementId` in the later scene's content WITHOUT adding a new `mediaGenerations` entry. Only the scene that first defines the `elementId` in its `mediaGenerations` should include the generation request — later scenes just reference the ID. For example, if scene 1 defines `gen_img_1`, scene 3 can also use `gen_img_1` as an image src without declaring it again in mediaGenerations

**Content guidelines for image and video prompts**

- Do NOT include violence, weapons, blood, or gore
- Prefer abstract, diagrammatic, infographic, or icon-based styles for educational illustrations
- Keep all prompts academic and education-oriented in tone

**When to use video vs image**:

- Use **video** for content that benefits from motion/animation: physical processes, step-by-step demonstrations, biological movements, chemical reactions, mechanical operations
- Use **image** for static content: diagrams, charts, illustrations, portraits, landscapes
- Video generation takes 1-2 minutes, so use it sparingly and only when motion is essential

#### Image example:

```json
"mediaGenerations": [
  {
    "type": "image",
    "prompt": "A colorful diagram showing the water cycle with evaporation, condensation, and precipitation arrows",
    "elementId": "gen_img_1",
    "aspectRatio": "16:9"
  }
]
```

#### Video example:

```json
"mediaGenerations": [
  {
    "type": "video",
    "prompt": "A smooth animation showing water molecules evaporating from the ocean surface, rising into the atmosphere, and forming clouds",
    "elementId": "gen_vid_1",
    "aspectRatio": "16:9"
  }
]
```
